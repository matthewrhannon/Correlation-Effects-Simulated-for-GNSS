# Correlation-Effects-Simulated-for-GNSS
Messing around with a specific PN sequence of GPS

This Matlab simulation first shows the auto-correlation gain obtained multiple integrations for
each of the first 37 pseudorandom noise (PRN) spreading sequences utilized in the global
positioning system (GPS). Next the cross-correlation gain for each of the 37 PRN codes are
shown. Finally, the abnormality is explained between the PRNs [34, 37] and [37, 34].
